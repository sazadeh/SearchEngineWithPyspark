# Build a SearchEngine With Pyspark
Here we try to build a search engine with pyspark without using use any existing libraries to compute TF-IDF or any builtin library to build the index or perform a search (e.g. elasticsearch)

**Part 1) Data Exploration**<br />
We have these Steps in our Final.py file:\
Upload the file: "shakespeare_full.json" to your linux machine and load its content to a dataframe df2.\
Show the count of entries grouped by “speaker” on df2.\
Output format: Two columns: “speaker” and “count”
